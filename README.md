# Minimal APIs in .NET 7

## Repository 
This repository was created to support my presentation at THAT Conference 2023:  https://that.us/activities/qVgSjI18fHaQmlQuS5M2

## Examples
The example solutions are a work in progress and represent different types of minimal api implementations.  You are free to take any of the code in these repositories.  I plan to update the solutions as I continue learning more about how to implement features in minimal apis.
